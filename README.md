# sam
Sam is a Lua's fork and of course is Sam also an extension programming language designed to support general procedural programming with data description facilities. Sam is intended to be used as a powerful, lightweight, embeddable scripting language for any program that needs one. Sam is implemented as a library, written in clean C, the common subset of Standard C and C++.
The objective of my project is to make Sam a favorite language teaching first time programmers. Lua is very simple to learn but lacks of somethings for teaching purpose.

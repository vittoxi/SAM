The objective of my project is to make Sam a favorite computer programming language teaching first time programmers. Sam is a Lua' fork because Lua is very simple to understand and hacks. My opinion is that Lua is not simply to learn for primary's school students and also lacks whit other "thinks" for teaching purpose. So I decided to create a programming language to solve this problems. I'm assuming that the problem really exists. However I do it for fun.

Sam should become a language 100% suited to 'teaching, starting from primary schools up to the universities. This objective and 'hard to reach. But not impossible.

The Sam's code is a Lua's programming language fork and of course is Sam also intended to be used as a powerful, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. Sam is written in clean C, the common subset of Standard C and C++.
